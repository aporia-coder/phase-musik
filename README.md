Implemented a music player using React and the Web Audio API, with a focus on design and a linear gradient composed of two colors from each individual track's album art revealing itself as each track plays, giving a unique design flare to the user.

Use the player controls to skip through tracks, or select a song from the library. You can also skip to certain parts of a song by clicking on the progress bar.
